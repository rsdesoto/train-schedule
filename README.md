# train-schedule

An app used to estimate when trains will leave.

Enter the train you wish to track, the first train of the day (in military time), the frequency of operation (in minutes), and it will estimate the next train's arrival time.

## Please note!!!

"First Train" is the _first train of the day_. If the current time is before the first train of the day, the app will give the number of minutes until the first train.
